"""Minimal NLP helpers for entity extraction and relations.

The original project used :mod:`spacy` for natural language processing, but
that introduces a heavy dependency and requires downloading language models.
For the purposes of the unit tests in this kata we only need extremely small
feature set, so this module implements a couple of simple regular-expression
based helpers.  They recognise the sentence pattern used in the tests and map
parts of the sentence into the entity schema used by the rest of the code.
